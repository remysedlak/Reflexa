# Reflexa - App Development Journey

## Live Demo
You can view an offline static version of the app here: [Reflexa Live Demo](https://remysedlak.github.io/Reflexa/)

## Project Overview

During the 2024 Winter break, I spent time researching the current app development market and exploring different technology stacks. After evaluating several options, I decided to start with a simple Django backend paired with React for the frontend.

This project serves as my hands-on exploration into learning the components, controllers, routers, and interactivity involved in web development.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Django (Python)
- **Frontend**: React (JavaScript)
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (server on localhost)

## Progress Timeline

### 12/30/2024

### 11/11/2025

- Moved js data analysis to a python app, which serves data through json response in django.
- Learned how to navigate AWS tools, learning some Ubuntu to run my RestAPI through the terminal.
- Focusing on learning proper repsonsive UI practices, so that the app looks proper on mobile resolutions.

- This is starting to come together a little bit more, this app is sloppy, but I am learning how the development process SHOULD go.
- I plan to add/learn more features until the app actually is useful, learning how to use tools and connect my ends
- Then, I will include more fields in my data, and try to keep a consistent UI/UX style

## What I’m Learning
- **React**: Components, state management, and building interactive UIs.
- **Django**: Building API endpoints, controllers, and routing.
- **Frontend-Backend Integration**: Managing data flow between the frontend and backend.

## Future Goals
- Continue refining the app's functionality.
- Restructure layout to work woth mobile browsers.
- Add more features like user authentication, database integration, and enhanced UI elements.
- Deploy the application for real-world use.

## Conclusion

This project is an ongoing exploration of full-stack web development. It allows me to grow my skills in both Django and React while building something tangible. I’m excited to see where this journey takes me and look forward to the progress I’ll make!

## Deployment

The site is deployed and accessible through [GitHub Pages](https://remysedlak.github.io/Reflexa/). This version is static, and while you can interact with the frontend, backend functionality is not yet integrated.
